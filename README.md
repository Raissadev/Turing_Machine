# Machine Turing

## Description

Speak devs! The Turing Machine is an abstract model of a computer, created by the so-called "father of computing" Alan Turing. The Turing machine is restricted only to the logical aspects of its operation (memory, states and transitions), and not its physical implementation. In a Turing machine you can model any digital computer, from the most recent ones.
So let's see this in practice, or better in code with a "turing complete" language

## Usage

### Start Machine
```shell
python3 index.py
```
